### `Components`

In this project , I have used several components to ease my work and have a unidirectional data flow of my components. first of all, I've used a header and a footer component which is shared by others. 

### `Routing`

In this project, react routing have been used to render the perspective destinations. 


### `Private Routing & Authentication`

Two components are being kept private due to security issues . They are servicedetails and admin dashboard. In this project, a bootstrap spinner also used to keep the users information so that as soon as they reload , their data don't get remove due to fetching issues from server.

### `Admin Dashboard`

Here in this project, we declare an admin dashboard to manage the users and service information . The dashboard is kept secured with private routing and there are 4 sections in that component.

### `Managing users`
A user must be logged into manage his product . He/she can add a product and delete the product what he/she chose.
